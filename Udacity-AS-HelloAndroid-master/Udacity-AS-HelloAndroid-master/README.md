* ***Withdrawal of the underlinings***

**SOLVED** [Bug on Samsung SM-J510FN (Android 7.1.1, API 25)](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/pbr-with-autolink-phone-on-mobile-phone-if-underlining-supressed/541923?u=benedicte55555): the withdrawal of the ***auto link phone***'s undelining is not supported. the
second code runs the app, but it slows down it and the phone link is no longer clickable. As far as the first code is concerned, it crashes the app!
