GITHUB REFLECTION N°1

How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	That was the first time I was using fc in my windows cmd! I thought that fc was going to tell me precisely here there is a typo difference, but I have to look among the several differences to see it. Fortunately there wasn't too much differences and only the differences appear.
	
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	I you have problem with your server or you IDE, if a part of your current version is no longer working, it is a great thing to have a version at hand either to go on with your work, either to redo the part of your code as before when it was working !
	
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
	The pros: you know perfectly where and what are your improvements in your code
	The cons: sometimes you can think that not enough changes have been done to create a commit and unfortunately you get in problem the days following (and it is too late!)
	
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	The fact that Git allows saving multiple files in one commit gives the possibility to compare the files quickly without having to do it manually
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	$ git log
	$ git diff f19cb1b80fe27e938e4d72770ca0a42f25e99ecc b0678b161fcf74467ed3a63110557e3d6229cfa6
	
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
    I tend to use the history tool of Android Studio which is marvelous and does the same. 
    But if I understand, the checkout does not destroy any file so I stay confident.
	
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
    Create an alias for my notepad++ !
